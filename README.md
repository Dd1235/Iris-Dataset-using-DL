# Iris-Dataset-using-DL

This project is a simple PyTorch implementation of a neural network classifier for the Iris dataset. The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning and contains measurements of various iris flowers' sepal and petal dimensions, along with their corresponding species labels.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how to build a basic neural network classifier using PyTorch for multiclass classification tasks. The model architecture consists of a simple feedforward neural network with two hidden layers, trained using the CrossEntropyLoss and Adam optimizer
